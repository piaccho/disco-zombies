# Disco Zombies
Mini 3D game project created with JavaScript and [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) - JavaScript 3D library. This project was an assignment for the AGH UST  Computer Graphics Programming course.

## Overview
The game allows the user to control a character and fight zombie NPCs in a disco club decorated with numerous lights and a spectacular spinning disco ball. Have fun!

## Installation
Before usage you must add [models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ALt_cJLqaPVbxUsHe6bCnEL4xDIAKPfq?usp=drive_link) to the *resources* directory. Due to GitHub's uploads limits I wasn't able to include them in the repository. Run the Live Server in the project directory.
